# Hospitality_Analysis_PowerBI

### Problem Statement:

AtliQ Grands operates several five-star hotels across India and has been a key player in the hospitality industry for 20 years. However, due to increased competition and suboptimal decision-making, they are experiencing a decline in market share and revenue within the luxury and business hotel segment. To address this challenge, the managing director has decided to integrate “Business and Data Intelligence” to help reclaim their market position and boost revenue. Unfortunately, they lack an in-house data analytics team capable of generating the necessary insights.

To fill this gap, the revenue management team has opted to engage a third-party service provider to analyze their historical data and deliver insights.

### Project Goal:

As a data analyst assigned to this project, tasks include:

1. Developing the specified metrics outlined in the provided list.
2. Constructing a dashboard based on the mock-up created by the stakeholders.
3. Generating additional relevant insights that go beyond the existing metrics and mock-up dashboard.
